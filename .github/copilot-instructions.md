## General

- Make sure to read all files in `.github/instructions/*.md`
- I will advise you to process task in the `tasks.md` file
- Please follow the instructions carefully and mark the task with `[-]` when started
- If you think you have finished the task make sure to
  - run all tests with `go test ./...`
  - run all builds with `go build ./...`
  - IT IS IMPORTANT THAT BOTH SUCCEED WITHOUT ERROR -> otherwise the task is not finished
- if the task is finished mark it as `[x]` and ask for a review
