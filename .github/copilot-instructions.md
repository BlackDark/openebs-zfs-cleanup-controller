## General

- Make sure to read all files in `.github/instructions/*.md`
- I will advise you to process task in the `tasks.instructions.md` file
- Please follow the instructions carefully and do the following always:
  - edit the task and mark with `[-]` when started in `.github/instructions/tasks.instructions.md`
  - review the referenced requirements and designs to fully understand how to handle the tasks
  - always start with test and build to make sure we are in a working state
  - If you think you have finished the task make sure to
  - run all tests with `go test ./...`
  - run all builds with `go build ./...`
  - IT IS IMPORTANT THAT BOTH SUCCEED WITHOUT ERROR -> otherwise the task is not finished
  - if you encounter anything weird add notes to the task so we can easily understand it
  - if the task is finished mark it as `[x]` in `.github/instructions/tasks.instructions.md` and ask for a review
